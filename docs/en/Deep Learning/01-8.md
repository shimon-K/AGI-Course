### Neural ODE (NODE)

- Special NNs such as Hamiltonian NN for Hamiltonian equations or Lagrangian NN for Euler-Lagrange equations, can be found in the paper: _“Hamiltonian neural networks for solving equations of motion - Marios Mattheakis et al”_ and in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEOcss20nDA&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQ0BaKuBKY43k4xMo6NSbBa&index=16&ab_channel=SteveBrunton).
- This video also based on [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-dynamical-systems-with-neural-ode-a-hands-on-guide-71c4cfdb84dc) article, [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-differential-equations-with-neural-networks-4c6aa7b31c51) article, and [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/physics-informed-neural-networks-an-application-centric-guide-dc1013526b02) article.

### PINNs

- This video also based on [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/physics-informed-neural-networks-an-application-centric-guide-dc1013526b02) article.
- Note that $f$ or the dynamic function is referred to as vector field. Why? Since it shows the trajectory (through time for ODE, and also through space for PDE) of any “particle” starting from some initial position.
- Enforcing causality in PINNs described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07404).
- PINNs could be extended to fractional PINNs handling integrals and fractional derivatives (incomplete ones). Also delta-PINNs that incorporates geometry prior of the problem. See more in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zrY7P2dVC4&ab_channel=SteveBrunton).
- A full online course about PI-ML in the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQ0BaKuBKY43k4xMo6NSbBa).



### RNN vs ODE

- Note that NODEs and PINNs without free parameters, are autonomous systems, i.e. determined deterministically by ICs and BCs. However, parameters are just like inputs to the system, that intervene/interfere the system, as also happens in RNNs, which in its turn affect the output. This idea is also illustrated in the state plane and input and output vectors interacting with it in [State space](https://shimon-k.github.io/AGI-Course/en/Classical%20AI/01-5/) section.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)


### On-policy and Off-policy learning


### Policy-based methods

- Note that RL methods split into two types: value-based (which we learned about in STATE SPACE slides in [here](https://shimon-k.github.io/AGI-Course/en/Classical%20AI/01-5/#DPMC) and [here](https://shimon-k.github.io/AGI-Course/en/Classical%20AI/01-5/#TD)) and policy-based which we learn here. The difference between these two types can be seen [here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-brief-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-7799af5840db).

### Gaussian Process and Kernels

#### Gaussian Process
<iframe width="760" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApYfcQXqygg" title="Gaussian Process (GP)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
- So how to draw the plot of mean function + uncertainty? Simply by calculating the mean and covariance in the train+test points.
- Note that it is actually $f^*\|y$ and not $f^*\|x^*$ GP posterior (see in black box). 
- See different GP distributions in [here](tinyurl.com/guide2gp or https://infallible-thompson-49de36.netlify.app/).
- More on GP [here](https://readmedium.com/en/but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-an-intuition-for-dummies-dd95ee20484a), [here](https://medium.com/panoramic/gaussian-processes-for-little-data-2501518964e4), and a python implementation [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/implement-a-gaussian-process-from-scratch-2a074a470bce).
- Great (with detailed math) GP [explanation](https://medium.com/data-science/understanding-gaussian-process-the-socratic-way-ba02369d804), following sparse/var GP versions: [here](https://medium.com/data-science/sparse-and-variational-gaussian-process-what-to-do-when-data-is-large-2d3959f430e7) and [here](https://medium.com/data-science/variational-gaussian-process-what-to-do-when-things-are-not-gaussian-41197039f3d4). Sparse GP is to reduce K dimensions, and variational as a way to avoid original K huge calculations.

- The _“Kernel summary”_ is based on [here](https://medium.com/@ryassminh/math-for-ml-kernels-explained-simply-with-examples-a24f5fd0699c), [here](https://medium.com/data-science/kernels-everything-you-need-to-know-f5d255d95785) and [here](https://youtu.be/y0FgHOQhG4w?list=PL93aLKqThq4hbACqDja5QFuFKDcNtkPXz (from time ~ 1:20:00).

## Linear regression and correlation

## Linear correlation and covariance matrix

- Note that besides $r$ or pearson linear correlation between continuous variables, there are other correlation measures for other variable types: cremer for ordinal or categorical variables, and spirmann for ordinal. While pearson is for interval or ratio scale variables.
- This section is the base for the _Gaussian processes_ in the [Bayesian Learning]() section.

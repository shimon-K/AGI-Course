title: Understanding

---


As we mentioned in <a href="https://shimon-k.github.io/AGI-Course/en/Introduction/Course presentation">here</a>, the elementary courses are usually offer _shallow_ understanding of concepts, ideas, topics, etc which we will refer to as _objects_. They concern mostly about practice and implementation. This is because they have the appropriate goal: to generate workers,  or people to apply their knowledge in desigining products.

More advanced courses offer more deep understanding of such _objects_, by developing more in mathematics and theory. This effect emphasizes the importance of understanding, and that it is a continuous concept, within several levels. These courses aim also for the same practicallity as the elementary courses, but are more inclined for research.

Our course is similar in this regard. It it also about deep unerstanding of _objects_, but with less emphasis on practicallity. It is also for research, but a more fundamental one. More theoretical and even philosophical, though eventualy for the purpose of practical AI.

_shallow_ learning often presents _objects_ as seperate and express usually only one facet of the _object_. _Deep_ learning, on the other hand, exhibit the inter-relation among differnet _objects_, that often presumed not connected. Additionally, it reveals many facets, of this _object_, thus expending the overall perception of it. It allows us to see "the bigger picture".

These are the principles that guide us through desgining and developing further this course. More about the philosophy of this course can be found <a href="https://shimon-k.github.io/Teaching.html">here</a>.

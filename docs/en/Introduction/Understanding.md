title: Understanding

---


As we mentioned in <a href="https://shimon-k.github.io/AGI-Course/en/Introduction/Course presentation">here</a>, the elementary courses usually offer _shallow_ understanding of concepts, ideas, topics, etc., which we will refer to as _objects_. They are concerned mostly about practice and implementation. This is because they have the appropriate goal: to generate workers,  or people to apply their knowledge in designing products.

More advanced courses offer a deeper understanding of such _objects_, by developing more in mathematics and theory. This effect emphasizes the importance of understanding, and that it is a continuous concept, within several levels. These courses aim also for the same practicality as the elementary courses, but are more inclined to research.

Our course is similar in this regard. It is also about deep understanding of _objects_, but with less emphasis on practicality. It is also for research, but a more fundamental one. More theoretical and even philosophical, though eventually for the purpose of practical AI.

_shallow_ learning often presents _objects_ as separate and expresses usually only one facet of the _object_. _Deep_ learning, on the other hand, exhibits the inter-relation among different _objects_, that are often presumed to be unconnected. Additionally, it reveals many facets of this _object_, thus expanding the overall perception of it. It allows us to see "the bigger picture".

<b>Unfortunately, _shallow_ courses are very mechanistic and technical. It is merely (or mostly) about introducing some tool to work with. This may lead to frustration and bewilderment, since meaning is missing, or the purpose of it all. _Deep_ courses provide this meaning. They sometimes show how very different _objects_ are related, or even how they were developed/discovered, and the philosophy behind these _objects_. This generates excitement and great motivation, and exhibits the beauty of the things we learn. For example, the symmetry or the harmony of things.</b>

These are the principles that guide us through designing and developing this course. More about the philosophy of this course can be found <a href="https://shimon-k.github.io/Teaching.html">here</a>.
